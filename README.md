This repo contains a random sample of pub packages, open source Flutter
applications, and open source Flutter widgets. It then applies an [experimental
branch][] of the Dart formatter to them so we can evaluate the formatting style.

[experimental branch]: https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_style/tree/flutter-style-experiment
